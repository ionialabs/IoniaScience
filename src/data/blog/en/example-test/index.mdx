  New JWST eclipse maps reveal the atmospheric structure of a scorching exoplanet in unprecedented
  detail, challenging theory and hinting at complex heat flows and chemistry.

The atmospheres of far-off worlds are secrets wrapped in starlight, but astronomers are finally peeling back the layers. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a team has produced the first detailed, wavelength-dependent eclipse map of an exoplanet’s dayside—offering the first true glimpse of temperature and chemistry variations across both horizontal and vertical dimensions on a planet beyond our own solar system.

> **TL;DR:**
> - JWST eclipse mapping of WASP-18b reveals unexpected temperature gradients and atmospheric features.
> - Results challenge existing models, implying roles for hydrogen dissociation and nightside clouds.

Ultra-hot Jupiters—giant planets skimming close to their stars—are stellar laboratories where heat and chemistry reach extremes not found in our solar system. The planet at the heart of this study, WASP-18b, is one such world, subject to immense stellar radiation. Traditionally, our tools only allowed astronomers to view blended spectra from an entire hemisphere, blurring fine atmospheric structure into a single, averaged profile. But the secondary eclipse mapping technique, newly enhanced by JWST's NIRISS instrument, now allows 2D brightness maps at multiple wavelengths, revealing how temperature and atmospheric composition vary in both latitude, longitude, and altitude.

The team analyzed a secondary eclipse event—when WASP-18b slipped behind its star—and used sophisticated methods (including Eigenspectra mapping) to produce brightness maps in 25 wavelength bins. These maps showed how the light from different regions of the planet changed as sections rotated in and out of view. By grouping together areas with similar spectra, they identified distinct atmospheric regions: a blistering 'hotspot' at the substellar point, a cooler 'ring' around the limbs, and an 'outer' region with low signal.

Surprisingly, the results show weaker longitudinal (day-to-night) temperature gradients than many theoretical models predicted. Instead of dramatic swings from day to night, the heat is more smoothly distributed. This suggests greater than expected heat transfer, possibly driven by hydrogen dissociation and recombination—exotic processes favored under the intense irradiation of WASP-18b. Alternatively, nightside clouds that trap and redistribute heat might play an important role, a factor not fully accounted for in some models.

The hotspot, hotter than the day's average by about 150 K, displays a strong thermal inversion—temperature increasing with altitude—attributed to high-altitude absorbers like TiO, VO, or H-. Meanwhile, the ring region, 400 K colder, shows less certain chemical signatures, likely because limb regions are seen at extreme angles, reducing the clarity of their spectral fingerprints. The spectra from just these two regions, when averaged, closely matched previous hemisphere-wide measurements, confirming that these new mapping techniques are capturing the dominant physics of the atmosphere.

These results matter because they challenge the standard general circulation models (GCMs) used to predict exoplanet climates. The unexpected weakness of temperature gradients, coupled with the need to include advanced physics like magnetic drag and non-uniform cloud coverage, means theorists must revisit and refine their treatment of heat transport. Additionally, the techniques used—spectroscopic eclipse mapping resolved both horizontally and vertically—open the door for similar studies of a wide array of exoplanets, moving the field from averaged snapshots to detailed atmospheric maps.

However, some important caveats remain. The eclipse mapping technique is computationally intense and relies on data with high signal-to-noise; the weakest region (the nightside edge) had too little information for robust analysis. The impact of spectral resolution on mapping results hasn't been fully explored and may affect interpretations. And while the findings point to the importance of hydrogen dissociation and possible cloud effects, not all physical processes—especially those dealing with complex cloud dynamics—are yet included in models. As JWST and future observatories gather more data, revisiting these conclusions will be essential.
