# Welcome to Galaxy!

This theme uses Astro v5 and Tailwind CSS v4, and includes some of my up-coming Starwind UI components and setup. These are more accessible and stable components than I was previously creating and I am excited to hear what you think of them.

## Quickstart

1. To get started, first install all necessary packages with `npm install` or `pnpm install`, then run an initial build to make sure the setup works `npm run build` or `pnpm build`.
2. Copy the Pagefind build (for site search) to be available for the dev environment. This varies depending on your OS. I've created a few commands to help.
   - For Windows, run `npm run winsearch`
   - For OSX or Linux, run `npm run osxsearch`
3. Next, you'll want to configure your site i18n setup (one language, or multiple). Simply run the command `npm run config-i18n` and follow the script instructions to get setup! For further information, see the [i18n documentation](https://cosmicthemes.com/docs/i18n/).
4. Now you can setup the site to your liking!
   - [Style customization](https://cosmicthemes.com/docs/styles/)
   - [Content editing](https://cosmicthemes.com/docs/content/)
   - [Animations](https://cosmicthemes.com/docs/animations/)
   - [Keystatic CMS](https://cosmicthemes.com/docs/keystatic/) - if you don't want Keystatic you can run `npm run remove-keystatic`
   - [Forms](https://cosmicthemes.com/docs/contact-form/)

## Code Intro

I have created a few code tours to help introduce you to the codebase. You will need the extension [Code Tour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) to view them in VSCode.

## Code Structure

The source files have the following setup. Note that not all files are included - it is already long, no one wants it to be longer.

For robots like Google to see the correct sitemap, you will want to edit the `public/robots.txt` file to use your website domain.

## General Astro Info

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. I also frequently use `src/assets` for images when using Astro asssets for image optimization.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
